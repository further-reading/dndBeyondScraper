# DnD Beyond Scraper
Scrapy practice - Learning how to scrape data from a DnD Beyond character sheet.

Currently scrapes character name and ability scores.

In current version it scrapes from an offline version of the sheet. Scraping a live sheet will invole the use of splashy to load javascript elements which will come later.
